MobileBoil
===================

In short, `MobileBoil` is a Skeleton-inspired grid-based javascript-less HTML5/CSS3 Boilerplate with a few notable differences:

- Mobile-first approach,
- No offset containers (they rendered unnecessary throughout many many of my projects),
- No nested column classes (rendered unnecessary throughout many many of my projects),
- Revised media-queries for a more modern device-base,
- New 1440px breakpoint in the same 16-base grid.

MobileBoil is as clean (if not even cleaner) and straightforward as Skeleton Boilerplate, same container-column structure is preserved, very easy to pick up and start coding in, and mobile-first simply makes more sense these days.
